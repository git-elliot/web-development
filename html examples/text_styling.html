<!--
The heading tags can be used to increase or decrease the size of the heading.
The heading tags can be used upto h6 only after which html won't recognize and will show the text as it is.
-->
  <h1>This is h1 text</h1>
  <h2>This is h2 text</h2>
  <h3>This is h3 text</h3>
  <h4>This is h4 text</h4>
  <h5>This is h5 text</h5>
  <h6>This is h6 text</h6>
<!--
Bold, italic can also be used to style text
-->
  <b>This is bold text</b>
  <i>This is italic text</i>
<!--
Strong text is used to show something important
-->
  <strong>This is strong text</strong>
<!--
You can combine two or more tags for custom styling.
-->
 <h1><b>This is bold h1 </b></h1>
 <h1><i>This is italic h1 </i></h1>
